[Verse 1]
So we see eachother again
but this time roles have reversed
You're trapped with me wnd not me with you

This nightmare of your own design
I'm gonna reuse quite fine
We both know this will never end

[INSERT CHORUS]

[Verse 2]

This time there's no saving grace
no saferoom, no axe nor springlock suit
You know this torment is DEEP INSIDE YOUR HEAD
